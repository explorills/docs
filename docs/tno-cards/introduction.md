# TNO Cards Introduction

!!! warning "Transition Phase"
    TNO Cards are temporary. Once the liquidity pool reaches **10 million EXPL** (~**$40,000 USD** at 1:1 ratio), TNO Cards phase out and the liquidity pool launches. At that point, EXPL becomes an ERC20 token and Nodes become the main distribution mechanism.

!!! info "Tokenized NFT Offering"
    TNO Cards let early adopters acquire EXPL before the main launch. Limited to 771,000,000 EXPL — just 1.38% of total supply. TNO allocations fund the initial liquidity pool, creating fair market entry before Node-based distribution begins.

**Current Status**: Available for purchase while we reach liquidity targets.

## Transition to EXPL Nodes

Once liquidity targets are met:

1. **Liquidity Pool Creation**: 10M EXPL minimum deployed
2. **ERC20 Deployment**: EXPL becomes tradeable
3. **TNO Phase Out**: TNO Cards program concludes
4. **Nodes Era**: Main distribution through EXPL Nodes begins
