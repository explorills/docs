# Welcome to ONE

We're building an escape hatch from digital chaos. Not thousands of mediocre apps drowning in AI slop and infinite scrolling — ONE perfect tool per category. Quality over quantity. Signal over noise. Purpose over profit.

## Why We Exist

We're open source, community-driven, and built outside the traditional capitalist playbook. No profit-hungry investors dictating roadmaps. No dark patterns designed to extract attention. We create what we love because the work itself is the point. The community decides what gets built, not quarterly earnings reports.

Every line of code lives on GitHub. Every decision happens in public. No corporate secrecy, no hidden agendas. Just transparent, community-owned infrastructure.

## Fair Economics

We split every dollar that flows through ONE:

- **40%** goes to Node owners (you)
- **50%** goes to ONE care (making the world better)
- **10%** goes to founders (keeping the lights on)

This isn't a company. It's a movement toward technology that works for everyone.
