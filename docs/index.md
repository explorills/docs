# Welcome to ONE

ONE is a decentralized ecosystem consisting of 10 specialized projects, each designed to address specific use cases within the blockchain and digital infrastructure space. The platform operates on a node-based architecture powered by EXPL Nodes, enabling distributed operations and token distribution.

## Architecture Overview

ONE operates as an open-source, decentralized infrastructure platform. Development is transparent with all code repositories publicly available on GitHub. The ecosystem is governed through community participation via EXPL Node operators who maintain network infrastructure and participate in protocol decisions.

Technical operations are managed through on-chain smart contracts that handle token distribution, escrow mechanisms, and node operations. This architecture eliminates centralized control points while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Economic Model

The ONE ecosystem implements a structured revenue distribution model:

- **40%** allocated to Node operators (infrastructure providers)
- **50%** allocated to ONE care (ecosystem development and community initiatives)
- **10%** allocated to founding team (core development and operations)

This distribution model aligns long-term incentives across operators, users, and developers while supporting sustainable ecosystem growth.
