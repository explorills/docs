!!! success "EXPL Nodes - The Living Brand"
    EXPL Nodes are the foundation of the entire ONE ecosystem, powering all deployed projects and infrastructure. Operated by community members, each EXPL Node generates daily mint permissions for $EXPL through immutable smart contracts. This decentralized approach eliminates reliance on centralized entities, enabling a secure and transparent environment for building community-driven products. EXPL Nodes create a stable and sustainable economic model that benefits the entire ecosystem through $EXPL.
