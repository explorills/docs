!!! success "EXPL Nodes Power Everything"
    EXPL Nodes are the foundation of the entire ONE ecosystem. Run by community members worldwide, each Node generates daily EXPL minting permissions through on-chain smart contracts. This decentralized model means no single entity controls the network — just transparent, community-owned infrastructure that benefits everyone.

## What are EXPL Nodes?

EXPL Nodes are more than network validators — they're the living infrastructure that powers everything we build. When you operate a Node, you're:

✅ **Powering Infrastructure**: Running the backbone for all ONE projects  
✅ **Minting EXPL**: Generating daily tokens through on-chain contracts  
✅ **Enabling Governance**: Participating in community decisions  
✅ **Creating Value**: Contributing to sustainable token distribution  
✅ **Building Community**: Connecting with operators in a shared economy
