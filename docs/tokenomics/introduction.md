# Tokenomics Introduction

!!! success "EXPL Token - Powered by EXPL Nodes"
    EXPL has a max supply of **55,783,940,100 tokens**. Distribution happens in two ways: through EXPL Nodes (76.19%) and direct mint channels (23.81%). Node operators mint tokens through on-chain contracts, which automatically flow to designated escrows and rewards. Direct channels let users mint based on engagement and activity.

**2026 Milestone**: EXPL ERC20 deployment with 10M EXPL minimum liquidity pool

## EXPL Nodes: The Distribution Engine

EXPL Nodes are the primary mechanism for EXPL distribution in the ONE ecosystem:

- Daily mint permissions through on-chain contracts
- Decentralized, community-operated infrastructure
- First batch: 12,000 Nodes operational in Q2 2026
- Main distribution begins after ERC20 deployment
