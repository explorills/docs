# Tokenomics Introduction

!!! success "$EXPL Token - Powered by EXPL Nodes"
    The $EXPL tokenomics framework is structured across several allocation categories, including Tokenized NFT Offering (transitional), EXPL Nodes operation incentives, user rewards, non-custodial escrows, community funds, and liquidity support. The total supply is capped at **55,783,940,100 $EXPL**, which is gradually introduced into the ONE ecosystem through EXPL Nodes-based distribution and direct mint channels.

**2026 Milestone**: $EXPL ERC20 deployment with 10M EXPL minimum liquidity pool

## Key Points

## EXPL Nodes: The Distribution Engine

EXPL Nodes are the primary mechanism for $EXPL distribution in the ONE ecosystem:

- Daily mint permissions through immutable smart contracts
- Decentralized, community-operated infrastructure
- First batch: 12,000 EXPL Nodes operational in Q2 2026
- Main distribution begins after ERC20 deployment
