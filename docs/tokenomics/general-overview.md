# General Overview

!!! info "Distribution Model"
    Out of the total supply of 55,783,940,100, 76.19% is allocated to Node-Based Distribution, covering explorills.ventures, explorills.care, community grants, developer incentives (bounties), Node referrals, and Node operators' NET. The remaining 23.81% is designated for Direct Mint Channels, including Liquidity Mining, Impermanent Loss Protection, HUB-Verified Users, Mystery-Box, and TNO. Unlike Node-Based Distribution, Direct Mint Channels operate independently, enabling users to mint $EXPL directly based on their engagement and activities within the explorills ecosystem.

## Node Operators & Their Role in $EXPL Distribution

The Node Operators are the only ones who can mint the $EXPL, based on the main distribution immutable smart contracts. As tokens are minted, designated portions are automatically allocated to various types of non-custodial escrows, while Node Operators retain a fixed portion of $EXPL from the total distribution during minting as a reward for contributing to the explorills ecosystem.

---

## TNO Purpose

Before $EXPL is deployed as an ERC-20 token, Nodes go live, and the main distribution begins, the initial allocation of $EXPL is available through the Tokenized NFT Offering (TNO). Early adopters can acquire $EXPL via TNO cards at [mint.explorills.com/#TNO-Bronze](https://mint.explorills.com/#TNO-Bronze) to get involved in the project.

The TNO is capped at 771,000,000 $EXPL out of the total supply of 55,783,940,100. These TNO allocations will initially be used to deploy the liquidity pool on the explorills platform, establishing a fair entry point and market consistency, before the Nodes main distribution begins.
