# General Overview

!!! info "Distribution Model"
    Out of 55,783,940,100 total supply: **76.19%** goes to Node-Based Distribution (covering ONE venture, ONE care, community grants, dev bounties, Node referrals, and operator rewards). The remaining **23.81%** goes to Direct Mint Channels (liquidity mining, impermanent loss protection, verified users, mystery boxes, and TNO). Direct channels let users mint EXPL based on their ecosystem engagement — no Node required.

---

## Node Operators & Distribution

Node operators are the only ones who can mint EXPL through the main distribution contracts. When tokens are minted, portions automatically flow to various non-custodial escrows, while operators keep a fixed portion as their reward for powering the ecosystem.

---

## TNO Purpose

Before EXPL launches as an ERC20 token and Nodes go live, early adopters can acquire EXPL through the Tokenized NFT Offering (TNO) at [node.expl.one/bronze](https://node.expl.one/bronze){:target="_blank"}.

TNO is capped at 771,000,000 EXPL (1.38% of total supply). These allocations will initially fund the liquidity pool on the EXPL.ONE platform, establishing fair market entry before Node-based distribution begins.
