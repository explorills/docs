# General Overview

!!! info "Distribution Model"
    Out of 55,783,940,100 total supply: **77.57%** goes to Node-Based Distribution (covering ONE venture, ONE care, community grants, dev bounties, Node referrals, operator rewards, and Founding Contributors Royalty). The remaining **22.43%** goes to Direct Mint Channels (liquidity mining, impermanent loss protection, verified users, and mystery boxes). Direct channels let users mint EXPL based on their ecosystem engagement — no Node required.

---

## Node Operators & Distribution

Node operators are the only ones who can mint EXPL through the main distribution contracts. When tokens are minted, portions automatically flow to various non-custodial escrows, while operators keep a fixed portion as their reward for powering the ecosystem.

---

## Founding Contributors Royalty

The Founding Contributors Royalty allocates 771,000,000 EXPL (1.38% of total supply) to founding contributors through gradual node-based distribution. Each of the 100,000 EXPL Nodes generates an additional **+10 EXPL daily** designated as founding royalty, distributed over a **731-day period**.

This model replaces the original TNO Cards program (now [archived](../archive/overview.md)), providing a healthier economic structure:

- **Gradual distribution** instead of one-time minting
- **Reduced sell pressure** through sustained, daily-paced release
- **Aligned incentives** — founders benefit as the Node network grows
- **Optimal for the ecosystem** — maintains stable and predictable token economics
