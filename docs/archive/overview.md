### TNO Cards (Tokenized NFT Offering)

The TNO Cards program — including all four card tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond) — has been **permanently discontinued**. The EXPL.ONE_TNO smart contracts on both Ethereum and Flare networks have been:

- **Paused**: All minting and transfer operations halted
- **Signer key set to dead address**: Public key set to `0x00dEaD`, making contract operations permanently inaccessible
- **Ownership renounced**: Contract ownership renounced on both Ethereum and Flare chains

The 1.38% of total supply (771,000,000 EXPL) originally allocated to TNO Cards has been **reallocated to the Founding Contributors Royalty**, distributed gradually through EXPL Nodes. This approach provides a healthier economic model through gradual distribution rather than one-time minting, reducing sell pressure and maintaining a stable, sustainable economy.

!!! info "Current Allocation Model"
    The EXPL supply previously allocated to TNO Cards is now distributed as **Founding Contributors Royalty** — each of the 100,000 EXPL Nodes generates an additional **+10 EXPL daily** for founding contributors over a 731-day period. This gradual distribution model maintains healthy tokenomics by avoiding large one-time mints.
