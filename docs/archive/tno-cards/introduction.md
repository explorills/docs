# TNO Cards Introduction

!!! danger "Archived — Program Discontinued"
    **This page is archived for historical reference only.** The TNO Cards program has been permanently discontinued. All EXPL.ONE_TNO smart contracts have been paused, the signer public key has been set to `0x00dEaD`, and contract ownership has been renounced on both Ethereum and Flare networks. The 1.38% allocation (771,000,000 EXPL) previously designated for TNO Cards has been reallocated to the **Founding Contributors Royalty**, distributed gradually through EXPL Nodes.

## Original Program Overview

TNO Cards were a temporary mechanism that allowed early adopters to acquire EXPL before the main launch. The program was limited to 771,000,000 EXPL — 1.38% of total supply — and was intended to fund the initial liquidity pool.

## What Replaced TNO Cards

The 1.38% supply allocation has been restructured as the **Founding Contributors Royalty**, distributed gradually through EXPL Nodes:

- **100,000 EXPL Nodes** each generate **+10 EXPL daily** as founding contributors royalty
- Distribution spans **731 days**, ensuring gradual and sustainable token release
- This model eliminates sell pressure from large one-time mints
- Total allocation remains **771,000,000 EXPL** (1.38% of total supply)
