**ONE network** is the blockchain infrastructure layer for the ONE ecosystem. Operated by EXPL Nodes, it provides distributed infrastructure for all ecosystem projects and services.

**Platform**: [network.expl.one](https://network.expl.one){:target="_blank"}

---

## Overview

ONE network serves as the foundational blockchain layer for the ecosystem. All transactions, smart contracts, and applications execute on infrastructure maintained by EXPL Node operators.

---

## Key Features

### Distributed Operations

- Decentralized network operated by EXPL Nodes
- Distributed consensus mechanism
- Protocol governance through node operators
- Transparent on-chain operations

### Powered by Nodes

- 12,000+ EXPL Nodes securing the network
- Daily EXPL minting through on-chain contracts
- Automated distribution
- Incentive-aligned infrastructure

### DeFi Ready

- Integrated liquidity pools for EXPL
- Liquidity mining programs
- Optimized transaction routing
- Real-time analytics

### Secure & Transparent

- Smart contract-based operations
- Verifiable on-chain transactions
- Cryptographic security
- Community-auditable

---

## Architecture

ONE network is designed as a horizontally scalable infrastructure that can support the growing demands of the ONE ecosystem:

### Consensus Layer
- Secured by EXPL Nodes operators
- Efficient consensus mechanisms
- Low latency transaction processing

### Smart Contract Layer
- EXPL minting contracts
- Liquidity pool management
- Governance mechanisms
- Cross-project integrations

### Application Layer
- APIs for ONE ecosystem projects
- Developer tools and SDKs
- Integration frameworks

---

## EXPL Token Distribution

ONE network facilitates the primary distribution mechanism for EXPL tokens:

- **Daily Minting**: EXPL Nodes generate mint permissions
- **Immutable Contracts**: Transparent, unchangeable smart contracts
- **Fair Distribution**: Community-operated, decentralized model
- **Sustainable Economics**: Long-term incentive alignment

## Liquidity Mining

### Participate in Network Growth

- Provide liquidity to EXPL pools
- Earn rewards for liquidity provision
- Support network stability and trading efficiency
- Transparent APY tracking and analytics

### Minimum Liquidity Target

- Initial target: 10M EXPL ($40k USD at 1:1 ratio)
- Enables TNO Cards transition
- Establishes sustainable liquidity depth
- Supports ecosystem-wide trading

---

## EXPL Nodes: The Foundation

EXPL Nodes function as network validators and infrastructure operators:

✅ **Operate Network Infrastructure**: Run and maintain distributed network nodes
✅ **Mint EXPL Tokens**: Execute daily token minting via smart contracts
✅ **Secure Transactions**: Validate and process on-chain transactions
✅ **Enable Governance**: Vote on protocol proposals and decisions
✅ **Earn Rewards**: Receive EXPL allocation for infrastructure operations
