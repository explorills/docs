  <p><strong>Core Blockchain Infrastructure Powered by EXPL Nodes</strong></p>
</div>

**ONE network** is the foundational blockchain infrastructure powering the entire ONE ecosystem. Operated and secured by EXPL Nodes, it provides the decentralized backbone for all projects, applications, and services within the ecosystem.

**Platform**: [network.expl.one](https://network.expl.one){:target="_blank"}

---

## Overview

ONE network serves as the core infrastructure layer that enables the ONE ecosystem to function as a truly decentralized, community-operated platform. Every transaction, every smart contract, and every application within the ecosystem relies on the security and performance provided by EXPL Nodes operators.

---

## Key Features

### Decentralized Infrastructure

**Community-Operated Network**

- Fully decentralized network operated by EXPL Nodes
- No reliance on centralized entities
- Community governance and decision-making
- Transparent network operations

### EXPL Nodes Integration

**Powered by the Community**

- 12,000+ EXPL Nodes securing the network
- Node operators mint $EXPL through immutable smart contracts
- Daily mint permissions distributed automatically
- Incentive-aligned infrastructure

### Liquidity Infrastructure

**DeFi Foundation**

- Integrated liquidity pools for $EXPL token
- Liquidity mining programs
- Optimized routing and transaction efficiency
- Real-time pool statistics and analytics

### Network Security

**Immutable & Transparent**

- Smart contract-based operations
- Verifiable on-chain transactions
- Cryptographic security guarantees
- Community audit capabilities

---

## Architecture

ONE network is designed as a horizontally scalable infrastructure that can support the growing demands of the ONE ecosystem:

### Consensus Layer
- Secured by EXPL Nodes operators
- Efficient consensus mechanisms
- Low latency transaction processing

### Smart Contract Layer
- $EXPL minting contracts
- Liquidity pool management
- Governance mechanisms
- Cross-project integrations

### Application Layer
- APIs for ONE ecosystem projects
- Developer tools and SDKs
- Integration frameworks

---

## $EXPL Token Distribution

ONE network facilitates the primary distribution mechanism for $EXPL tokens:

- **Daily Minting**: EXPL Nodes generate mint permissions
- **Immutable Contracts**: Transparent, unchangeable smart contracts
- **Fair Distribution**: Community-operated, decentralized model
- **Sustainable Economics**: Long-term incentive alignment

## Liquidity Mining

### Participate in Network Growth

- Provide liquidity to $EXPL pools
- Earn rewards for liquidity provision
- Support network stability and trading efficiency
- Transparent APY tracking and analytics

### Minimum Liquidity Target

- Initial target: 10M EXPL ($40k USD at 1:1 ratio)
- Enables TNO Cards transition
- Establishes sustainable liquidity depth
- Supports ecosystem-wide trading

## EXPL Nodes: The Foundation

EXPL Nodes are not just validators—they are the living heart of ONE network:

✅ **Operate Network Infrastructure**: Run and maintain network nodes  
✅ **Mint $EXPL Tokens**: Generate daily mint permissions  
✅ **Secure Transactions**: Validate and process network activity  
✅ **Enable Governance**: Participate in ecosystem decisions  
✅ **Earn Rewards**: Receive $EXPL for network contributions
