!!! info "Game Systems Designer | World Builder | Mechanics Architect"
    I design deep, interconnected game systems where every mechanic has purpose and every rule tells a story. My approach combines technical precision with narrative depth, creating economies, combat systems, and progression mechanics that feel intuitive yet offer mastery.
