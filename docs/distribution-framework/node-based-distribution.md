# Node-Based Distribution

!!! info "Operator-Driven Distribution"
    Node-Based Distribution depends on Node operators. EXPL only flows to escrows when an operator mints it, triggering the automated allocation.

---

## Daily Minting Permissions

Each Node generates **574.30 EXPL** worth of daily minting permission (or **591.40 EXPL** if purchased via referral code). This includes **10 EXPL** designated as Founding Contributors Royalty. Operators can mint daily or accumulate permissions and mint later. Until minted, the tokens don't exist in the ecosystem.

---

## Distribution Breakdown

When you mint, tokens automatically distribute to designated escrows. From the base **574.30 EXPL** permission:

- **342 EXPL** splits evenly between ONE care and ONE venture escrows
- From the remaining **232.30 EXPL**:
  - **34.2 EXPL** → Community Grants escrow
  - **17.1 EXPL** → Developer Incentives escrow
  - **171 EXPL** → Node operator (your reward)
  - **10 EXPL** → Founding Contributors Royalty

---

## Founding Contributors Royalty

Each Node generates an additional **+10 EXPL daily** as royalty for founding contributors. This allocation replaces the former TNO Cards program and distributes the same 1.38% of total supply (771,000,000 EXPL) gradually through Nodes over **731 days** across all **100,000 Nodes**.

This gradual distribution model:

- Eliminates large one-time mints that create sell pressure
- Aligns founder incentives with long-term ecosystem health
- Maintains stable, predictable token economics
- Ensures sustainable, daily-paced token release

---

## Referral Bonus

If your Node was purchased via referral code, daily minting increases to **591.40 EXPL** (574.30 + 17.1). The extra **17.1 EXPL** goes directly to the referrer's address.
