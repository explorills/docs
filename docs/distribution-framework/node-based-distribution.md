# Node-Based Distribution

!!! info "Operator-Driven Distribution"
    Node-Based Distribution depends entirely on the Node operators. $EXPL tokens are only distributed to the respective escrows when a Node operator mints them, allocating the designated shares of $EXPL.

---

## Daily Minting Permissions

Each Node generates a daily minting permission of **564.30 $EXPL** in total, with an additional **17.1 $EXPL** if Node was purchased using a referral code. The operator can mint these tokens daily or accumulate them over any period and mint them all at once. Until minted, these tokens do not exist within the ecosystem.

---

## Distribution Breakdown

When minting occurs, the tokens are automatically distributed to designated escrows. For instance, from the 24-hour generated minting permission of **564.30 $EXPL** (excluding referrals):

- **342 $EXPL** is split evenly between the ONE care and ONE venture escrows
- From the remaining **222.30 $EXPL**:
  - **34.2 $EXPL** is allocated to the Community Grants escrow
  - **17.1 $EXPL** to the Developer Incentives escrow
  - **171 $EXPL** is kept by the Node operator as a reward for contributing to the EXPL.ONE ecosystem

---

## Referral Bonus

If the Node was purchased via a referral code, the daily minting permission increases to **581.40 $EXPL** (564.30 + 17.1). The additional **17.1 $EXPL** is minted directly under the referring address.
