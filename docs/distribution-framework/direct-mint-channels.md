# Direct Mint Channels

!!! info "Independent Minting"
    Through Direct Mint Channels, $EXPL is minted independently of the EXPL.ONE Nodes, with a total of five distinct channels provided below.

---

## Available Channels

### 1. Liquidity Mining

By providing $EXPL and its paired token as liquidity, $EXPL is minted directly via the liquidity platform based on the amount provided and the locking duration.

**Key Features:**
- :material-chart-line: Rewards based on liquidity amount
- :material-lock-clock: Duration-dependent minting
- :material-swap-horizontal: Direct platform integration

---

### 2. Impermanent Loss Protection

Since long-term liquidity provision can lead to impermanent loss, a special protection pool is offered. This ensures that Liquidity Providers get back the exact amount of tokens they originally provided, regardless of market changes.

**Key Features:**
- :material-shield-sync: Protection against impermanent loss
- :material-restore: Guaranteed token recovery
- :material-clock-check: Long-term LP support

### 3. HUB-Verified Users

The first million users who obtain HUB-verified status on the EXPL.ONE platform generate a mint permission of **1.71 $EXPL** on a daily basis, per user, for **731 days** at the provided address.

**Key Features:**
- :material-account-check: First 1,000,000 verified users
- :material-calendar: 1.71 $EXPL per day for 731 days
- :material-calculator: Total of 1,250.01 $EXPL per verified user
