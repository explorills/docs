# Distribution Master Map

!!! info "Distribution Categories"
    The $EXPL distribution is divided into two main categories: Node-Based Distribution and Direct Mint Channels. Through Node-Based Distribution, only Node Operators mint $EXPL, which is allocated to specific non-custodial automated escrows and Node operators. On the other hand, Direct Mint Channels allow users to mint $EXPL independently, without Nodes participation, as long as they meet the foundational system requirements.

$EXPL Distribution Master Map outlines the total maximum supply of $EXPL and its allocation across various ecosystem components. Each component receives $EXPL through different distribution mechanisms, with its respective maximum supply shown as a percentage of the total.

## Key Principles

!!! note "Distribution Mechanism"
    **Node-Based Distribution** requires Node operators to actively mint tokens, which are then automatically allocated to non-custodial escrows and operators based on predefined ratios.
    
    **Direct Mint Channels** enable users to mint $EXPL directly by meeting specific platform requirements, independent of Node operations.
