# Distribution Master Map

!!! success "EXPL Nodes-Powered Distribution"
    The EXPL distribution is divided into two main categories: **EXPL Nodes-Based Distribution** and **Direct Mint Channels**. Through EXPL Nodes-Based Distribution, only EXPL Nodes operators mint EXPL, which is allocated to specific non-custodial automated escrows and node operators. Direct Mint Channels allow users to mint EXPL independently, without Nodes participation, as long as they meet the foundational system requirements.

**2026 Launch**: Main distribution begins with 12,000 EXPL Nodes operational in Q2 2026

The EXPL Distribution Master Map outlines the total maximum supply of EXPL and its allocation across various ONE ecosystem components. Each component receives EXPL through different distribution mechanisms, with its respective maximum supply shown as a percentage of the total.

## Key Principles

!!! note "Distribution Mechanism"
    **Node-Based Distribution** requires Node operators to actively mint tokens, which are then automatically allocated to non-custodial escrows and operators based on predefined ratios.
    
    **Direct Mint Channels** enable users to mint EXPL directly by meeting specific platform requirements, independent of Node operations.
