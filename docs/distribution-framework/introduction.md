# Distribution Master Map

!!! success "EXPL Nodes-Powered Distribution"
    EXPL distribution happens in two ways: **EXPL Nodes-Based Distribution** and **Direct Mint Channels**. Through Node-based distribution, only Node operators mint EXPL, which automatically flows to specific non-custodial escrows and operator rewards. Direct channels let users mint EXPL independently based on ecosystem activity — no Node required.

**2026 Launch**: Main distribution begins with 12,000 EXPL Nodes operational in Q2 2026

The Distribution Master Map shows the total max supply and how it's allocated across the ONE ecosystem. Each component receives EXPL through different mechanisms, with percentages shown relative to total supply.

## Key Principles

!!! note "How It Works"
    **Node-Based Distribution** requires Node operators to mint tokens, which then automatically allocate to non-custodial escrows and operators based on fixed ratios.
    
    **Direct Mint Channels** let users mint EXPL directly by meeting specific platform requirements — independent of Node operations.
